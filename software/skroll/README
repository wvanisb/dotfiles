===========================

Skroll is a small utility that you can use to make a text scroll.
Pipe text to it, and it will scroll a given number of letters from right to
left.

You can pass a few options to it, to change its behavior:

    # loop indefinitely
    echo shblah | skroll -l

    # output <n> chars at a time
    echo shblah | skroll -n 3

    # rotate letters every <x> seconds
    echo shblah | skroll -d 0.25
